Examples
--------
This section contains some documented examples of common toy problems often
encountered in the evolutionary computation community. Note that there are
several other examples in the ``deap/examples`` sub-directory of the
framework. These can be used has ground work for implementing your own flavour
of evolutionary algorithms.
